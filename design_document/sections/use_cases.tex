\subsection{Blue sky scenario:}
The software doesnâ€™t break, slow down or cause the employee any confusion. This means that the food truck is able to get through customers faster and is therefore able to make sales. The analytics  also need to be correct in order for the truck is able to accommodate for all the customers as the software is rendered useless and the truck cannot make anymore sales if there is stock left to make customers orders. Therefore the speed, reliability and analytics that the software provides is very important in the success of the business.
