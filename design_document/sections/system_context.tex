This system, FoodByte, is expected to be used in either a small caf√© or food truck, by the owners and employees to assist in managing the flow of orders and various day to day operations. Employees will be using the system the majority of the time it is in use so it is important the system will enhance their work and not interfere with it. Managers are able to interact with the system to manage stock, menus, menu items as well as view or refund past order transactions. The system can also communicate to the cooks/baristas to provide them with information on each order including a hierarchical tree displaying items within the order and items if any that correspond to their structure.
