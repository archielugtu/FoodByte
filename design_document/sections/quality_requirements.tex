Quality requirements describe the expectation of a customer for the system, and how it performs. The quality requirements were determined by going through the processes of the system and discussing if there were quality related expectations at given points. For example, when an order is being placed the user/employee should not have to deal with the software crashing. In the two tables below the quality requirements are split into requirements for management and operational sides of the system, ordered by priority. \\ \\The table below shows the ranking of importance of the quality requirements for this system application. These quality requirements are what the team considered as essential for this application. These are availability, reliability, speed, usability, maintanbility, portability, scalability.
For each stakeholder, there is a set weight value representing their importance level in the system. Each of them is assigned a metric value representing the level of significance for each of the quality requirements for the system application. The result above clearly shows the level of significance for each of the quality requirements of the system.\\ \\

The table shows that Reliability has the highest overall level of significance according to the stakeholders selected. This shows that having software that's reliable and non-erroneous plays a big role in the development of the application. Having a non-reliable and error-prone system heavily impacts our application, as customers would not want something that is not working properly.
